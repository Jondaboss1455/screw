A screw is a simple machine that converts rotational motion into linear motion, effectively increasing force to drive objects into materials or lift heavy loads. It consists of a helical ridge, or thread, wrapped around a cylindrical core. When turned, the helical thread moves the screw along its axis, allowing it to hold materials together or lift objects by creating a mechanical advantage. The concept of the screw dates back to ancient Greece, with Archimedes around 250 BCE credited for its early use in the Archimedean screw, a device for raising water. Over time, screws have evolved from their basic, manually operated forms to complex, precision-engineered components used in everything from construction to machinery, highlighting their enduring utility in various technological advancements.
